# Neuralang: A Compiled Interoperable Scripting Language Built for Machine Learning
![demo1](./readme/demo1.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è This compiler is experimental and might have breaking changes with each update.

üí¨ Got some questions or feedback? Just open an issue, and we'll be glad to respond!

_Neuralang_ is a compiled language with support for interoperability with any LLVM language (i.e. C, C++, Haskell, Rust, etc.) with a focus on machine learning.  _Neuralang_ ships with several features:
* **Interoperability**, allowing you to attach this code to any LLVM supported language.
* **Typing**, allowing for more readable - flexible code.
* **C-level speeds**, no more bottlenecks due to poorly maintained Python libraries

## Inspiration
Modern day machine learning is all done on python, making not very extendable - good luck trying to have Rust and Python communicate with each other without having two separate processes running.  _Neuralang_ seeks to solve this by making a scripting language built in LLVM (low level virtual machine) - allowing anybody with knowledge in most modern languages to have access to machine learning embedded in _your_ program without the need for creating multiple programs to have concurrent machine learning.

## Interoperability
![demo2](./readme/demo2.png)
Interoperability is archived because of LLVM's IR - or intermediate representation.  By using an LLVM-compatible compiler, such as `clang`, `llvm-rs`, or any other LLVM bindings for that specific language interoperability is easy.  The target language's code will be compiled to the IR.  For example the code shown above depicts C-code that has been compiled down to its intermediate representation.  This is then combined with the code compiled in _Neuralang_ to be called from either language!  The standard library for this language was written in C and interop-ed with _Neuralang_ as a proof on concept.

## Compiler Structure
![demo3](./readme/demo3.png)

The compiler is split into three parts: the frontend, which contains the AST and Lexer, the middle-end which contains the "passes", and the backend, which converts the code into LLVM-IR.  

To reiterate in a more descriptive fashion:

The frontend defines how _Neuralang_ defines its syntax.  It sets rules in abstractions called ASTs, or abstract syntax trees.  Then, the Lexer looks and searches for valid tokens in this language - which are essentially syntactical components in the langauge - splitting them into tokens.  Then, comes the parser.  The parser comes and puts everything together.  It reads the file, puts it through the Lexer, and based off of what the Lexer returns, it will piece the code together.

The back end is essentially just a bunch of LLVM imports, with a code-generation method.  What this generation method does is that it tells LLVM - hey, this function exists, please convert it to IR.  It is done by defining the IR (kind of human-readable assembly) code that will be compiled in a higher level form - in this case, C++.

## Challenges we ran into

LLVM's documentation leaves much to be desired in the way of clarity and content. As such, implementing LLVM was very difficult and took the bulk of the time to get working.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created our own language in 2 days! It has basic functionality and, what we think, is good modern-day high-level syntax. 

## What we learned

We learned how to build our own language interpreter that can compile code down to IR. We also learned how to link multiple IR files together, and compile it down to machine code, creating an executable.

## What's next for NeuraLang

Moving forward, we plan to add a lot more functionality. These include quality of life improvements, and new features, like GPU integration, and more predefined classes. Also, hopefully more new features and built-ins to help users.
